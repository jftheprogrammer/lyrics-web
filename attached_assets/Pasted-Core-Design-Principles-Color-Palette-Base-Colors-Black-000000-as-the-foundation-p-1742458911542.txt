Core Design Principles

    Color Palette:
        Base Colors: Black (#000000) as the foundation, paired with deep grays (#333333).
        Accents: Neon or blood red (#FF0000), electric purple (#800080), or toxic green (#00FF00) for pops of rebellion.
        Subtle Tones: Off-white (#F5F5F5) or faded yellow (#FFFACD) for distressed, vintage vibes.
        Inspiration: Think faded band posters, scratched vinyl, or dimly lit venues.
    Typography:
        Primary Font: Use gritty, stencil-like fonts like “Stencil” or “Punkboy” (free on Dafont). Alternatively, “Courier New” for a typewriter, DIY feel.
        Secondary Font: Handwritten or scratched styles like “SickCapital Kingston” or “Emo Tears” to mimic journal entries or zine text.
        Style: ALL CAPS for punk aggression, or lowercase for emo introspection. Mix bold and thin weights for contrast.
    Textures & Backgrounds:
        Grunge: Scratched, splattered, or torn paper textures (e.g., free assets from Freepik or Texture Labs).
        Patterns: Checkerboard (black/white or black/red), plaid, or static noise for a lo-fi punk edge.
        Background: Dark gradient (black to deep gray) with subtle grain or a collage of punk flyers.
    Imagery:
        Icons: Skulls, safety pins, broken hearts, guitars, or cassette tapes—hand-drawn or pixelated for authenticity.
        Photos: Black-and-white band shots, grainy Polaroids, or moody silhouettes. Add a ripped-edge effect.
        Animations: Glitch effects, flickering text, or shaky hover states to mimic punk’s raw energy.

Layout Recommendations

    Header:
        A bold, jagged logo (e.g., your site name in a scratched font) with a neon underline or dripping effect. Add a tagline like “scream it out” in smaller, messy text.
        Navigation: Horizontal menu with buttons styled like torn stickers or graffiti tags. Hover effects could crack or bleed color.
    Main Content:
        Grid: Asymmetrical or overlapping sections—think zine layouts with text boxes askew. Use CSS Grid with uneven columns.
        Song Database Integration: Display songs in a “setlist” format (e.g., a scratched chalkboard table). Each entry could have a “play” button styled as a cassette or a “lyrics” link with a torn paper popup.
        User Area: For login/register (if tied to your credentials idea), use a “backstage pass” card design with distressed edges and a barcode.
    Sidebar/Footer:
        Sidebar: A vertical “punk manifesto” or playlist widget with a taped-on look.
        Footer: Black with white scribbles—band names, lyrics, or a “built in the basement” vibe.
